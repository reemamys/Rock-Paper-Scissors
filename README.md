Project Title:
Rock-Paper-Scissors - Java Console Game

Description:
A fun console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in Java. 
The player competes against the computer by choosing Rock, Paper, or Scissors. 
The game keeps track of wins, losses, and ties, and allows the player to play multiple rounds. 
This project was created to practice Java fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, methods, and basic object-oriented programming.

Features:
1- Player vs. Computer gameplay with random computer choices
2- Input validation to ensure only Rock, Paper, or Scissors are accepted
3- Tracks user wins, computer wins, and ties
4- Declares winner after each round
5- Replay option to play multiple rounds
6- Announces the final winner when the player ends the game

Why I made this: 
I built this project to improve my understanding of Java programming. It helped me practice handling user input, making decisions with conditionals, working with methods and classes, and managing simple game logic in a fun and interactive way.
